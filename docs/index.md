# Charmed Apache Cassandra documentation

```{warning}
The charm is under active development and is not yet published on Charmhub.
APIs, configuration options, and integration endpoints may change.
```

Charmed Apache Cassandra is an open-source **Juju charm** that automates the deployment, scaling,
configuration and operations of [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) clusters across clouds,
virtual machines and bare metal, using the [Juju](https://juju.is/) orchestration framework.

[Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) is a free and open-source database management system
designed to handle large volumes of data across multiple commodity servers, providing high availability
with no single point of failure.

The charm aims to simplify Cassandra operations from
[Day 0 to Day 2](https://codilime.com/blog/day-0-day-1-day-2-the-software-lifecycle-in-the-cloud-age/),
offering secure defaults, integration interfaces, and lifecycle automation.

<!-- ## Key features

- **Scalable deployments**: easily bootstrap single-node or multi-node Cassandra clusters
- **Upgrades made safe**: charm refreshes and Cassandra software upgrades with minimal disruption
- **Observability by default**: seamless integration with the Canonical Observability Stack (COS) for metrics, logs, and dashboards
- **Secure communications**: built-in TLS support for encrypted traffic between nodes
- **Authentication**: automatic generation of initial system credentials and secure password rotation with Juju secrets -->
